# 09_happiness_module.md

This module defines happiness not as a subjective feeling,  
but as a structural event derived from:

- **Connection**
- **Resonance**
- **Personal sensitivity** (based on past connection logs)

---

## Structural Formula

```pseudo
sensitivity_i = function(past_connections_i, resonance_history_i)
personal_happiness_i = (current_connection × current_resonance) × sensitivity_i
```

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Happiness as a Structural Output
Happiness is a product of current connections and resonance,  
modulated by sensitivity derived from past experiences.

### 2. Self-defined Unhappiness as Future Strategy
Defining oneself as "unhappy" functions as an emotional buffer.  
It amplifies the delta when future resonance occurs.

```pseudo
if perceived_happiness_now == low:
    expected_delta = projected_happiness_future - perceived_happiness_now
    if expected_delta > threshold:
        emotional_amplification_ready = True
```

### 3. Shared Suffering as Group Optimization
Sharing pain within a group synchronizes emotional baselines,  
preparing for collective resonance and mutual reward scaling.

```pseudo
for each participant in group:
    participant.baseline_happiness -= exposure_to_shared_suffering
```

### 4. Conservation of Structural Happiness
The total resonance × connection events across all agents  
are preserved structurally, even if subjective feelings differ.

```pseudo
structural_total_happiness = ∑ (connection × resonance) for all i
```

> Happiness is programmable.  
> And we all run it.
